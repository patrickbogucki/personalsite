		<h1>Patrick Bogucki</h1>
		<h2>Web Developer</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a full stack web developer that works by looking at the whole picture. I want to spend as much time as possible making sure that what I create can be done quickly but also maintained easily, which is why staying on top of all the latest best practices, standards, frameworks and build tools is so important to me.
		</p>
		<p>
			While trying to better my skills and increase my knowledge I'm constantly looking for new ways to do so. I'm always open to new offers so feel free to contact me and perhaps we can work together soon!
